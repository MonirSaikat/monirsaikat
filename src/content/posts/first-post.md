### Exploring PHP Reflection Class

In PHP, the ReflectionClass provides a way to inspect classes, interfaces, functions, methods, and properties at runtime. It allows you to retrieve information about these elements, such as their name, methods, parameters, and more. This can be particularly useful for tasks like auto-generating documentation, debugging, and implementing advanced features like dependency injection containers.

### Getting Started

Let's dive into a simple example to understand how to use the ReflectionClass in PHP.

### Sample Codebase

Consider a basic PHP class named `User` with some properties and methods:

```php
<?php

class User {
    public $name;
    private $email;

    public function __construct($name, $email) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->email = $email;
    }

    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }

    private function getEmail() {
        return $this->email;
    }
}

// Create a ReflectionClass instance for the User class
$reflection = new ReflectionClass('User');

// Get class name
$class_name = $reflection->getName();
echo "Class Name: $class_name\n";

// Get class properties
$properties = $reflection->getProperties();
echo "Properties:\n";
foreach ($properties as $property) {
    echo $property->getName() . "\n";
}

// Get class methods
$methods = $reflection->getMethods();
echo "Methods:\n";
foreach ($methods as $method) {
    echo $method->getName() . "\n";
}

?>
